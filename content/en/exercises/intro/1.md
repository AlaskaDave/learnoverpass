The Overpass API is a powerful, read-only API that lets you query data from OpenStreetMap.

The Overpass Query Language (QL) is the language you use to 'talk' to this API and ask for data for your own specific use.

On the right is a text editor where you can type in your QL commands. See the code with the word `node`? That's a QL statement, which stands for - you guessed it, the humble node.

You see that blue box? That's a visualization of the data that's received by your statement. Right now it contains nothing, because while we query the node with the first line, the API doesn't know what to do with it! Let's change that!

1. `node` queries our node, but what does the number `2681940781` stand for? It's the unique identifier number (ID) of the node we're looking for.
2. The first statement looks (queries) for a specific node. On the second line, type in `out;`, which would print that node.

node(2681940781);
out;
